#### 2 Why Lead Magnets
Offer: The products or services you exchange for money and the terms associated with the exchange.

Core Offer: The thing you make the most money from.

Lead Magnet: A complete solution to a narrow problem given away at a significant discount (or free) to attract ideal customers.

Once a lead magnet solve the narrow problem, it should reveal the next problem...solved only by your core offer.

Salty Nuts Example.
Costco Food Sample Example.

Lead magnets get prospects one step closer to buying your stuff.
-A person who pays with their time now is more likely to pay with their money later.

#### 3 What & Who
Problem - Solution Cycle

 Action step: Pick WHO and WHAT valuable narrow problem to solve them
#### 4 How to solve: LEAD MAGNET TYPES
3 Types of Lead Magnets
##### LEAD MAGNET TYPES
#####  #1 REVEAL PROBLEM
Reveal their problem: Think "diagnosis". Works great for problems that get worse while you wait.
Ex:
- ﻿﻿Speed test on website
- ﻿﻿Posture Analysis
- ﻿﻿Termite Inspection
##### #2 FREE TRIAL
Samples & Free Trials: Think "a taste". Limit # of uses, time they have access or both.
Ex:
- ﻿﻿Faster server to speed up website load times
- ﻿﻿Free Back Adjustment
- ﻿﻿Food, cosmetics - any consumables. "Fun sized"
##### #3 FREE STEP 1 OF X
One step of a multi-step process: Think "one of many steps."
Ex:

- ﻿﻿Free garage door wood sealant - 1 of 3 coats.
- ﻿﻿Free course/calculator templates that are first step.

Be a legal drug dealer and you'll make money like one.
Action Step: Pick how you want to solve the narrow problem (Reveal, Sample, One step of many)

#### 5 How to deliver: DELIVERY MECHANISMS
##### DELIVERY MECHANISMS
##### #1 SOFTWARE 
Software: You give them a tool. If you have a spreadsheet, calculator, or small software, your technology does a job for them.

Ex: Give a spreadsheet, dashboard for gyms that gives them all relevant stats & compares to industry avgs.
##### #2 INFORMATION
Information: You teach them something. Courses, lessons, interviews with experts, keynote presentations, live events, mistakes and pitfalls, hacks/tips, etc. Anything they can learn from.

Ex: I give a mini course away to gyms on how to write an ad.
##### #3 SERVICES
Services: You do work for free. Adiust their back. Perform a website audit. Apply the first layer of garage sealant. Transform their video into an ebook. Etc.

Ex: I run gym owners ads for free for 30 days.
##### #4 PHYSICAL PRODUCTS
Services: You give them something they can hold in their hands. Posture assessment chart, a supplement, a bottle of garage door sealant, boxing gloves to get boxing gym leads, etc.

Ex: I sell a physical book called Gym Launch Secrets.


Each of these work with the 3 "how to solves."
Action Step: Pick HOW you want to deliver the solution (Reveal, Sample, One step of many)

#### 6 Name it
"After you've written your headline you've spent 80 cents of your advertising dollar" - David Ogilvy

How to do this in reverse order of money and audience size:

Run Ads
Run poll
Do it on every platform
Make post and ask people to comment
DM people in your list asking

Action Step: Test what to name it
Bonus Points: If people ask for it when they respond, you've got a winner.

#### 7 Make it easy
People do things that are easiest for them. Give them options.
Fact: ¼, ¼, ¼, ¼ split between Ebook/audio/video/physical copy

Software: Accessible on phone, computer & multiple formats
Info: Use all consumption preferences
Service: Available more times, more ways, more days.
Physical Products: Simple to open and use. Ex: Apple

#### 8 Make it good
0 FLUFF
- Give away the secrets sell the implementation
- ﻿﻿Have more than one valuable thing - be better  
- Market judges you on your FREE stuff not paid.
	- People make purchasing decisions based on a prediction of future value
- ﻿﻿Sucky fluff discourages people who would've bought not to.
- ﻿﻿People judge the value they'll get from your paid thing based on value of the free thing.  
- People buy based on expectation of future value. Easiest way to get them to think they'll get value after they buy is... provide value before they buy.
#### 9 Create next steps: СТА
##### СТА
1) What to do: clear, simple, direct language
	- If you're a company doing $IM to $10M in profit, apply at Acquisition.com!
2) Reasons to do it right now
	- We stopped taking companies for 5 months last year and recently opened back up. Do it before we close up again.
	Scarcity
	Urgency
	Reason Why - Fraternity Party Planner

#### "Great leads want great lead magnets."
A great lead magnet:
1) Engages ideal customers when they see it
2) Gets more people to engage than your core offer alone
3) Is valuable enough people consume it
4) Makes the right people more likely to buy

End Result: More people show interest in our stuff. We make more money. We improve our brand. All at same
# CORE FOUR:
## Core Four

#### 7. ﻿﻿﻿Warm up
Warm Outreach: A-C-A Framework
- Acknowledge
- Compliment
- Ask Next Question
Note: This is also how you talk to other humans btw.

- Acknowledge: what they said, then restate it to show you're listening.
Ex: Two kids...and you're a full time accountant.


- Compliment: on whatever they tell you. Tie it to a positive character trait if you can.
Ex: supermom! So hardworking! Managing a FT career + 2 kids...
- Tie the compliment to a POSITIVE character trait. Tie it to a positive identity or sense of self. Consistency bias of they want to be consistent to their character.


- Ask Next Question: Lead the conversation in a direction closer to your offer.
Ex:
Therapy- Do you get time for yourself?
Fitness Do you have time to get workouts in?
Cleaning Do you have anyone who helps you keep the house tidy?


People love talking about themselves, let them. They pay therapists $100/hr to do it. You're providing value by giving a poo. 
**They also will like and trust you more if you do.  That makes them more likely to buy from you. We want that.

#### 8. ﻿﻿﻿Invite Friends

HIT THE VALUE EQUATION

Here's what to say:

...By the way, do you know anybody who is (describe their struggles) looking to (dream outcome) in (time delay)? I'm taking on five case studies for free, because that's all I can handle. I just want to get some testimonials for my service/ product. I help them (dream outcome) without (effort and sacrifice). It works. I even guarantee people get (dream outcome) or I work with them until they do. I just had a girl named XXX work with me (dream outcome) even though she (describe the same struggle your contact has). I also had another guy who (dream outcome) and it was his first time. I'd just like more testimonials to show it works across different scenarios. Does anyone you like come to mind? (Pause if on the phone) …and if they say no... Haha, well... does anyone you hate come to mind? (ha) This helps break any awkwardness.

###### Important notes:
1. ﻿﻿﻿We're not asking them to buy anything
2. ﻿﻿﻿We're asking if they know anyone
3. ﻿﻿﻿Who wants something for free.

And if you have even less time:

1 help (ideal customer) get (dream outcome in (time period) without (effort & sacrifice) and (increased perceived likelihood of achievement).

**This short & sweet version works well for email, texts, dms, calls, in-person. Just fill in the blanks.

##### Pro Tip: 11 Ways To Increase Perceived Likelihood of Achievement
Include one or more of the following:
1. ﻿﻿﻿Showing proof we have done what they want (our own story)
2. ﻿﻿﻿Showing proof of people just like them getting what they want (think testimonials)
3. ﻿﻿﻿Showing the sheer volume of happy reviews we've received (think lots of 5-stars)
		a) If you don't have reviews yet, even the number of people you've helped works.
4. ﻿﻿Certifications/Degrees/Third party accreditations that we're legit
5. ﻿﻿﻿Numbers, stats, research that supports the outcome you want them to believe
6. ﻿﻿﻿Experts vouching for us
7. 1.Some new/unique characteristic they haven't failed with before (so it might work this time)
8. ﻿﻿﻿Celebrities who have endorsed us ('they trusted them, so should I')
9. ﻿﻿﻿Guaranteeing they'll achieve it (so we put some skin in the game too)
10. ﻿﻿﻿﻿How well you describe them or the current pain they're experiencing. The more specific the better. (think 'he/she really gets me, they must know how to help')
11. ﻿﻿﻿﻿If possible, demonstrate the outcome live. Or, show a recording of it happening.
	a) Ex: Advertising agency plays a recording of a call that a gym owner has to make to a lead on the sales call. "Could you handle making a call like that to a lead if we get them for you?" It demonstrates the outcome of the advertising services - people don't want "leads" they want customers. They just don't know a better way to ask for them.

#### 9. ﻿﻿﻿Easiest Offer
Since I'm only taking on five people, I can give you all the attention you need to get brag-worthy results. And I'll give it all for free so long as you promise to: 1) Use it 2) Give me feedback and 3) Leave a killer review if you think it deserves one. Does that sound fair?
##### Here's Why:
1. ﻿﻿﻿You get the reps in and become comfortable with making offers to people. It'll calm your nerves knowing you're just helping…for free... for now (winky face).
2. ﻿﻿﻿You probably suck (for now). People are far more forgiving when you haven't charged anything.
3) Because you probably suck, you need to learn how to suck less. You suck less by doing more. It's better to have a few guinea pigs to get the kinks out. You'll learn a ton from the people you help for free, I promise. Even though it may not feel like it now, you're getting the better end of the deal.
4) If people get value, especially for free, they're far more likely to:  
	a. Leave positive reviews and testimonials.
	b. ﻿﻿﻿Give you feedback.
	c. ﻿﻿﻿Send their friends and family.

##### Free customers make you money in three ways:
1. ﻿﻿﻿They convert into paying customers.
2. ﻿﻿﻿They send you paying customers via referrals.
3. ﻿﻿﻿Their testimonials bring in paying customers.

##### Hinge Method:
If you ask for a referral, get a three-way introduction. My favorite way to do this in person is grab the customer's phone, take a picture of the two of us, then text that picture to the referral and your own number. If I'm virtual, screenshot a video call and do the same thing. If you can't do that, then at least get a three way conversation going with them initiating it.

Yes = Free Customer
No = Info To Improve

If they say no - ask why:
-What would I have to do to make it worthwhile for you to continue?

Gives you a chance to solve the problem and exposes hidden costs to make your product better.

Just because it doesn't cost money, doesn't mean it's free.

#### 10. ﻿﻿﻿﻿Restart at the Top
After reaching out to all leads with your free offer, go to the next platform.

Then once you've done all platforms, start back at the top.
#### 11. ﻿﻿﻿﻿Start Charging
Here's how you know you're good enough: When people start referring OR you don't have more capacity to take people on. When that happens, swap "free" for #80% off the next five" then 60% off...etc.

Every 5 Raise +20%
Keep the "raise my price every five" as long as you want or until you reach a sweet spot. Btw - it's usually much higher than you think. This also gives you true scarcity at all times.

##### Get More Cash Up Front & More Yeses - Prepay + Guarantee
Offering a guarantee gets more people to buy because it reverses risk. Here's a nice twist on a guarantee that'll get you more yeses and more cash.

You can offer a guarantee only to people who pay up front. Reason why: People who invest up front are more committed. And as a result, we're able to guarantee their outcomes. So if you'd like our guarantee, you can prepay our service.

Another version of wording I got my good friend Dr Kashey: After the person agrees to buy, you say "would you rather pay less today or get all your money back?" Paying less today = payment plan, so less money down. Get all your money back = prepay and get a guarantee that you get the result you want.

Ex: "Pay Less" = $2000/mo for 3 months = $6000 (no guarantee)
Or
"Get All Your Money Back" = $6000 up front with a guarantee.

Presented this way, the majority of the people take the up front cash option with the guarantee. So if you planned on offering one anyways, you may as well weaponize it to incentivize more people to pay up front.
#### 12. ﻿﻿﻿﻿Keep List Warm
PROVIDE VALUE
Are you still looking to 4 word desire?
…buy your dream home?
..get more sales leads?
...tone up your arms?
…open an online store?
..start a youtube channel?

### Warm Outreach: Action Checklist
![Screenshot 2025-11-13 at 5.44.28 AM.png](/img/user/Atlas/Utilities/Images/Screenshot%202025-11-13%20at%205.44.28%20AM.png)
## Post Content
1) Quick Story
2) How it works
3) Content Unit
4) Hook
5) Retain
6) Reward
7) Long vs Short Content

### 1) Quick Story
### 2) How it works
Posting Content = More Scalable than Warm Outreach.
Pros:
- ﻿﻿Grows warm audience (who you can reach out to)
- ﻿﻿Makes all other advertising more effective
- ﻿﻿Just costs time. Can get you highest return per dollar.
Cons:
- ﻿﻿Difficult to personalize
- ﻿﻿Compete with everyone. Difficult to stand out.
- ﻿﻿If you're good. People copy. Have to innovate.

### 3) Content Unit
HOOk: Have a reason to consume it-›get them to notice your content
RETAIN: Pay attention long enough-›get them to consume it
REWARD: Satisfy their reason for consuming

Note: The smallest pieces of content like a tweet or meme or jingle do all three-at the same time. But I'll break each component apart so we can learn how to do them better.

### 4) Hook
Objective: We give them a reason to redirect their attention from whatever they are doing towards us.
#### We get lots of people to pay attention by doing three things well:
1. ﻿﻿﻿Pick good topics they find interesting
2. ﻿﻿﻿Pick good headlines that give them a reason
3. ﻿﻿﻿Match the format that's rewarded them before
##### Topics:
1. ﻿﻿﻿Far Past: Life lessons
2. ﻿﻿﻿Recent Past: Calendar breakdown
3. ﻿﻿﻿Present: Real time capture (tweets/emails)
4. ﻿﻿﻿Trends: Apply your lens to something happening
5. ﻿﻿﻿Manufactured: Turn a crazy idea into reality
My favorite way to pick topics: Do shit. Talk about what you did. Repeat.
##### Headlines: Instead of a formula - model the news.
1) Recency - As recent as possible, quite literally the 'new's
	a) People pay attention to something that happened an hour ago more than a year ago.
2) Relevancy - Personally meaningful
	a) Nurses pay more attention to stuff that affects nurses compared to stuff that affects accountants.
3) Celebrity - Including prominent people (celebrities, authorities, etc.).
	a) Normally, we wouldn't care what another human has for breakfast every day. But if it's Jeff Bezos, we do. Since he's a celebrity, many people care.
4) Proximity - Close to home - geographically
	a) A house on fire across the country doesn't get your attention. If it's your neighbor, it sure does. Make it as close to home as possible.
5) Conflict - of opposing ideas, opposing people, nature, etc...
	1. ﻿﻿﻿Pineapple vs no Pineapple on pizza? Conflict!
	2. ﻿﻿﻿Good vs Evil. Hero vs Villain. Left vs Right.
	3. ﻿﻿﻿Freedom vs Security. Justice vs Mercy. You get the idea.
6) Unusual - odd, unique, rare, bizarre
	e) Think of a six-fingered man at the old-time circuses. If it's outside of the norm, people pay more attention.
7) Ongoing - Stories still in progress are dynamic, evolving, and have plot twists.  
	f) If someone goes into labor, people want updates every ten minutes because anything could happen.
##### Format:
- Depends on the platform
 Bottom Line: You've gotta make your content look like what they expect will reward them. Otherwise, no matter how good it is, better-looking content will hook them before yours even has a chance.



### 5) Retain
We retain through curiosity. People want to know what happens.next. My three favorite ways:
#### LISTS
Lists: Lists are things, facts, tips, opinions, ideas, etc. presented one after the other. Good lists in free content also follow a theme. Think "Top 10 Mistakes" or "5 Biggest Money Makers" and so on. Giving the number of listed items in your headline, or in the first few seconds of your content, tells people what to expect. And in my experience, this retains more of the audience's attention for longer.
1. ﻿﻿﻿Example: "7 Ways I invested $1000 in my 20s That Paid Off Big"
2. ﻿﻿﻿Example: "28 Ways To Stay Poor"
3. ﻿﻿﻿Example: "A content unit has three pieces.."
#### STEPS
Steps: Steps are actions that occur in order and accomplish a goal when completed. Provided the early steps were clear and valuable, the person will want to know how to do them all to accomplish the overall goal.
1. ﻿﻿﻿Example: "3 Steps to Creating a Great Hook"
2. ﻿﻿﻿Example: "How I Create a Headline in 7 Steps"
3. ﻿﻿﻿Example: "The Morning Routine That Boosts My Productivity,
Here's the difference between steps and lists. Steps are actions that must be done in a specific order to get a result. So steps are less flexible but have a more explicit reward. Lists can have just about anything on them in any order you want. So lists are more flexible but have a less explicit reward.
#### STORIES
Stories describe events, real or imaginary. And stories worth telling often have some lesson or takeaway for the listener. You can tell stories about things that have happened, might happen, or will never happen. All three drive curiosity because people want to know what happens next.
Ex: Almost every section in this course has a story.
Ex: "My editor made me do 19 drafts of this book - here's what I did to him."
Ex: "My journey from sleeping on the bottom floor of a gym to the top floor of a 5-star hotel."

And…..the best part...you can use all three at the same time.
### 6) Reward
Reward: How good your content is depends on how often iT - ﻿﻿rewards your audience in the time it takes them to consume it. - ﻿Think value per second.

Example: The same person who gets bored three seconds into a ten-second video may also binge a 900-page book. And that same person may binge a television series for eight hours straight. So there is no such thing as too long, only too boring.

Now, we can't guarantee a specific reward. But, we can increase ﻿﻿the chance reward happens by:
- ﻿﻿Hooking the right audience with proper topics, headlines, and formatting  
- Retaining them with lists, steps, and stories to get them curious and wanting more
- ﻿﻿Clearly satisfying the reason the content hooked them to begin with.
##### Bad Example: If your hook promises "7 Ways to Make Up with Your Spouse" and you give:
(A) four ways
(B) seven ways that stunk (or they've heard them all before).
(C) you're talking to a room of single guys who don't have spouses. you did a bad job of rewarding. 
- People will not want to watch again, and certainly won't share it.

Bad Example: If your hook promises "4 Marketing Strategies Dentists Can Use" and they can't use them, they will not share it or watch your content in the future. You did a bad job of rewarding.

 ##### HOW TO KNOW IF YOUR STUFF IS GOOD:
- ﻿﻿So no matter how good you think your content is, the audience decides.  
- Rewarding your audience means matching or exceeding their expectations when they decide to consume your
- Here's how you know if you succeeded: your audience grows. If it's not growing, your stuff isn't that good. Practice and you'll get better. 
- Provide more value than anyone else. Make good on your promises. Clearly satisfy the hook you used to get their attention.

### 7) Long vs Short Content
Long = More content units
Short = Fewer content units
That's it.

It takes more skill to reward a lot over a longer period of time. So my recommendation is, start with short. Build from there.

It's the same reason comedians start with short 5min bits then work up to a full hour long routine.
###### Tip You Didn't Ask For: Make All Your Content For Strangers
Here's why: It grows your audience faster.
Existing audience won't mind.
New audience will want it to feel included.

## Monetize Content
1) The Give : Ask Ratio
2) How to Ask
3) Scale Content
4) How I Do It
5) Why It's Worth It
6) 7 Lessons
7) My First Post
8) Benchmarks
### 1) The Give : Ask Ratio
Gary Vee: Jab…..Jab...Jab...Right Hook
Here's why it works: Reciprocity.
->Deposit. Deposit. Deposit. Withdraw.

#### Well Studied Ratio: ~3:1 To Maximally Monetize
TV: Per 60min: 3.6 to 1 - 47 min Content - 13min Commercials
VS
FB: Per 5 Posts: 4 to 1 - 4 Content - 1 Ad

Maximally Monetize = Maximum Growth
FB: Per 5 Posts: 4 to 1 - 4 Content - 1 Ad
VS
TIKTOK: Far fewer ads for years (zero in the beginning)

#### How I do it: Give... until they ask.
How I do it: Give in public, ask in private. That way your reputation is based purely on giving.

Bottom Line: The moment you start asking for money is the moment you decide to slow down your growth. So the more patient you are, the more you will get when you finally make your ask.




### 2) How to Ask
#### If you're going to ask in public, here's my preference:
Think of 'asks' like commercials. You interrupt your own value with commercials about the stuff you sell.

Two Ways:
1. ﻿﻿﻿Integrated
2. ﻿﻿﻿Intermittent
##### 1. ﻿﻿﻿Integrated
Integrated: You can advertise in every piece of content so long as you keep your give : ask ratio high. You will continue to grow your warm audience and get engaged leads. Win-win.

Example: if I make an hour-long podcast, having 3 x 30-second ads means I'd have 58.5 min of giving to 1.5 min of asking. Well above the 3:1 ratio.

Don't be like my friend: I had a friend who had a podcast that blew up quickly. Eager to monetize his new audience, he started making offers (asking) too frequently -in- the content. His podcast not only stopped growing, it actually shrank! Don't be like that.

How I Prefer: Integrate the 'asks' - aka - CTs after a valuable moment or the end of the content piece. Consider trying one of those places first - and make sure your audience growth doesn't slow. Then add in the second and so forth. POWER OF A PS STATEMENT.
##### 2. ﻿﻿﻿Intermittent
Better for short form content.

Intermittent: The second way you can monetize is through intermittent asks. Here's how it works. You make many pieces of content of pure 'gives' then occasionally make an 'ask' piece.

Example: You make 10 'give' posts, and on the 11th, you promote your stuff.
##### Lead Magnet Example:
If I just talked about a way to get more leads on a post/video/podcast/etc., I would then say, "I have 11 more tips that have helped me do this. Go to my site to grab a pretty visual of them." And as long as I have an audience that wants to get more leads, this will get some of them to engage. Then, the thank you page after the opt-in page for my lead magnet would display my paid offer with some video explaining how it works. Bonus points if your lead magnet is relevant to your content advertising it.
##### Offer Example:

You can also 'go for the jugular' with your core offer and go straight for the sale. The direct path to money. We model our offer from the last chapter.

"I'm looking for 5 (specific avatar) to help achieve (dream outcome) in (time delay). The best part is, you don't have to effort and sacrifice). And if you don't get (dream outcome), I will do two things (increase perceived likelihood of achievement): 1) I will hand you your money back 2) I will work with you until you do. I do this because I want everyone to have an amazing experience with us and because I'm confident I can deliver on my promise. If that sounds fair, DM me/book a call/comment below/reply to this email/ etc."
##### So pick:
1. ﻿﻿﻿Integration or intermittent strategy
2. ﻿﻿﻿Lead magnet or core offer.
Then get back to giving.
### 3) Scale Content
#### How I Scale Content
1. DEPTH THEN WIDTH
2. WIDTH THEN DEPTH
##### 1. DEPTH THEN WIDTH: GO DEEP ON ONE PLATFORM
Step #1: Post content on a relevant platform.
Step #2: Post content regularly on that platform.
Step #3: Maximize quality and quantity of the content on that platform. Short form, you may sometimes be able to get up to ten times per day per platform. Long form, you may have to get up to five days per week (see soap operas).
Step #4: Add another platform while maintaining the quality and quantity on the first platform.
Step #5: Repeat steps 1-4 until all relevant platforms are maximized.

Pros: Maximize return on effort. Audiences compound faster. Fewer resources.
Cons: Less low hanging fruit. No omnipresence. Single channel dependency.
##### 2. WIDTH THEN DEPTH: GET ON EVERY PLATFORM EARLY THEN MAXIMIZE
Step #1: Post content on a relevant platform.
Step #2: Post content regularly on that platform.
Step #3: Here's where this strategy differs from the one before. Instead of maximizing your first platform. Move onto the next relevant platform while maintaining the previous.
Step #4: Continue until you are on all relevant platforms.
Step #5: Now, maximize your content creation on all platforms.

Pros: Broader audience faster. Repurpose with little effort.
Cons: More attention, time and labor to be effective. Often - lots of bad content everywhere.
### 4) How I Do It
#### How I Did It
lam not a full time content creator. I run businesses. But, content creation is a part of my responsibility. Here's my simple process for recording.
1. ﻿﻿﻿I find topics using the five ways from the "Hook" section.
2. ﻿﻿﻿I sit down twice every month and record thirty or so short clips based on step 1.
3. ﻿﻿﻿On the same day, I record 2-4 longer videos unpacking tweets that had more stories or relevant examples. This creates my longer form content.
If this sounds simplistic, it's because it is. Just start. You can add volume over time.


### 5) Why It's Worth It
#### STORIES
Story: Paid Ads Suffering.but why?
Team meeting-›Debate-›Leila "what did we stop?"--> Gym
Content- Customer Survey-78% Findings
### 6) 7 Lessons
#### 1) Switch from "How to" to "How I" whenever possible.
- ﻿﻿I make my oatmeal this way vs. you should make your oatmeal this way.
- ﻿﻿How I Built My 7F Agency vs. How To Build a 7F Agency.
- ﻿﻿My favorite way to generate leads for my business vs. This is the best way to generate leads for your business.
#### 2) We Need To Be Reminded More Than We Need To Be Taught:
- ﻿﻿Your audience doesn't listen 100 percent of the time.
	- ﻿﻿1 in 6 people in my audience didn't know I had a book despite posting about it daily for 2 years.
- ﻿﻿You'll get bored of your content before your whole audience even sees it.
#### 3) Puddles, Ponds, Lakes, Oceans.
- Narrow the focus of your content.
	- If you have a small local business, you probably shouldn't make general business content. The audience will listen to people with better track records than you.
Example: plumbing in a certain town. If you do that, you can become king of that puddle. Over time, you can expand your plumbing puddle to the general local business pond. Then the lake of brick & mortar chains and so forth. Then eventually, the ocean of general business.
#### 4) Content Creates Tools For Salespeople.
- ﻿﻿Some content will perform well and get more people interested in buying your stuff. That content helps your sales team.
	- ﻿﻿Create a master list of your "greatest hits."
	- ﻿﻿Label each 'hit' with the problem it solves and the benefit it provides.
#### 5) Free Content Retains Paying Customers.
- ﻿﻿How a customer gets value from you matters less than where they got it.  
    - Imagine a person pays for your thing and then consumes your free content. If your free content is valuable, they will like you more and stay loyal to your business longer.
	- ﻿﻿What do they judge off more? Free content VS Paid Content
#### 6) People don't have shorter attention spans, they have higher standards.
Repeated for emphasis: there's no such thing as too long, only too boring.
- ﻿﻿Streaming platforms have proven that people will spend hours binging long form content if they like it.
	- ﻿﻿Make good stuff people like and reap the rewards rather than whining about people's "short attention spans."
#### 7) Avoid Pre- Scheduling Posts.
- ﻿﻿The posts I manually post perform better than ones I pre-schedule.
	- ﻿﻿When you manually post, you know that within seconds you will be rewarded or punished for the quality of the content.
	- ﻿﻿It gives that last bit of pressure to get it right. Try it.
### 7) My First Post
#### Your First Post
You've probably been providing value to other humans knowingly or unknowingly for a while. So the first post you make, you can... MAKE AN OFFER
![Screenshot 2025-11-13 at 9.05.56 PM.png](/img/user/Atlas/Utilities/Images/Screenshot%202025-11-13%20at%209.05.56%20PM.png)

#### Main point:
Don't be afraid of what other people think.
-  If someone won't speak at your funeral, you shouldn't care about their opinion while you're alive.


### 8) Benchmarks
If our audience grows, we did good. But if our audience grows fast, we did gooder. So I like to measure my audience size and speed of growth monthly.
#### Here's what I measure:
##### 1) Total followers and reach - How big
1. Follower Example: If I go from 1000 followers across all platforms to 1500, I grew my audience by 500.
2. Reach Example: If I go from 10,000 people seeing my stuff to 15,000 people seeing my stuff, I grew my reach by 5,000 people.
##### 2) Rate of getting followers and reach - How fast
1. ﻿﻿﻿Example: If I gained those 500 followers in a month, that would make it a 50% growth month. (500 New / 1000 Started = 50% growth rate).
2. ﻿﻿﻿Example: If I reached those 5000 extra people in a month, that would make it a 50% growth month. (5000 New / 10,000 Started = 50% growth rate)

Compare the growth between months
##### Remember, we can only control inputs. Measuring outputs is only useful if we are consistent with inputs.
- ﻿﻿pick the posting cadence you want to stick with on a particular platform.
- ﻿﻿Then pick your 'ask' cadence on that platform (how you will direct people to become engaged leads
- ﻿﻿Then, start, and...Do. Not. Stop.
It's amazing what you can accomplish if you don't stop once you start.

## Cold Outreach
#### 1. How it Works
We advertise to people who don't know us. Cold audiences. And like before, we can contact them publicly or privately.

What is this? Private one-to-one advertising with cold outreach

If you can figure out a way to contact somebody one-to-one you can use it for cold outreach.
- ﻿﻿You knock on 100 doors.
- ﻿﻿You make 100 phone calls.
- ﻿﻿You send 100 direct messages.
- ﻿﻿You send 100 voicemails.

Cold outreach has one key difference from warm outreach:
TRUST - Strangers don't trust you.

##### Compared to people who know us, strangers present three new problems.
1. ﻿﻿﻿First, you don't have a way to contact them. Duh.
2. ﻿﻿﻿Second, even if you can contact them, they ignore you.
3. ﻿﻿﻿Third, even if they give you their attention, they're not interested.

#### 2. How to Contact
Simple Answer: Build a List
1. "SCRAPE 'EM" SOFTWARE
2. "Buy'EM " PAY BROKERS
3. "LooK FOR' Em" MANUAL SEARCH
##### Step #1 Softwares:
1. ﻿﻿﻿Subscribe to as many as you can
2. ﻿﻿﻿Search them all based on your criteria
3. ﻿﻿﻿Try out a representative sample (few hundred from each software I use.)
4. ﻿﻿﻿IF the contact information is up to date, the leads are responsive, and they are the type of person the software claims them to be, bingo!
5. ﻿﻿﻿Buy MORE!
##### Step #2 Brokers:
1. ﻿﻿﻿Go to multiple list brokers and ask them to make you a list (based on audience criteria.)
2. ﻿﻿﻿They then send me a sample. I test out sample lists from each of the brokers.
3. ﻿﻿﻿If I get good results from one or more brokers, I stick with their lists.
##### Step #3 Elbow Grease:
- ﻿﻿Join groups and communities that I think have my audience.
- ﻿﻿When someone meets my qualifications, I check to see if they have ways to contact them in the group's directory (links to their social media profiles, etc.)
- ﻿﻿If they do, I add them to my list.
- ﻿﻿If they don't, I can reach out to them within the platform hosting the group.
##### Action Step: 
Find your scraping tool by searching "outbound leads scraping tool" or "database lead scraping." Find brokers the same way. If you have more time than money, you might want to start at step three since it only costs time.
##### Pro Tip: Interest Groups Are The Warmest Cold Audience You Can Get
Interest groups contain the highest quality leads because they are concentrated pools of people looking for a solution. Give them one. Nowadays, there's software that can scrape information from these groups. Use it. They're one of my favorite places to fish.

#### 3. ﻿﻿﻿What to Say
##### Personalize, Then Give Big Fast Value
a) They Don't Know Us-›Personalize (Act Like You Know Them)
- ﻿﻿Cold reach out to look like a warm reach out.
	- ﻿﻿The best way to do that is to actually know something about the person you are contacting (Area Code -> Name -› Something about them)
Personalization is what gets your foot in the door to get the sale.
##### Action step: 
Do a little research on each lead before you send them a message.
- ﻿﻿Invest time
- ﻿﻿Pay people
- ﻿﻿Pay software
*Use notes to figure out the first thing you'll open with to feel more familiar.
##### Pro Tip: 50% Email Response Rate Bump
I took our cold outreach template and re-wrote it below a third grade reading level. The results: 50% more leads responded. I recommend running all scripts and messages through a free reading level app online. I won't recommend one because they go out of business all the time, but I promise you can find one. Make your messages easier to understand and more people will respond.


b) They Don't Trust Us-›Big Fast Value.
- The key difference between people who know you and strangers is…strangers give you far less time to prove your worth.
	-  "Give away the farm."
We're not trying to tickle their interest, we're trying to blow their minds in under thirty seconds.
##### Action Step: 
Provide the biggest fastest value you can afford to with your lead magnet or offer.
- ﻿﻿Write your scripts.  
    Note: Phone and chat scripts are never more than a page or two, and cold emails rarely more than half a page. So don't overthink it.
	- ﻿﻿Tweak them as you learn
#### 4. ﻿﻿﻿How much to do
##### Problem #3: "I'm not getting enough chances to tell people about my amazing stuff, what do I do?"
Volume
1. ﻿﻿﻿Automate delivery
2. ﻿﻿﻿Automate distribution
3. ﻿﻿﻿Follow up more times in more ways.


##### a) Automated Delivery. 
To the extent that we can, automating delivery unlocks huge scale.

Manual Examples: A live person can say a script to someone over the phone. You can send a personal voice memo to each lead. A person can write a handwritten letter to every person on the list. If it takes a person time to convey the message each time, it's manual.

Automated Examples: We can send a pre-recorded voice memo to someone's direct messages. We can send a pre-recorded voicemail to someone's voicemail box. We can send templated emails to an inbox or a templated text to someone's phone. We can send a pre-recorded video. Etc. You record your message one time and then send the same message to everyone.
##### Pro Tip: Use Technology That Gets You More Engaged Leads For Your Time
Everyday, artificial intelligence, deep fakes and other technology advance. They become more indistinguishable from human communication. This means we will be able to automate elements of what we currently are forced to spend time on. Embrace technology as it comes out to reap the rewards. Ultimately, technology serves a single purpose - to get us more output per unit time. Use it.


##### b) Automate Distribution. 
Once we have our messages prepared, we gotta distribute them.

Automated examples: Use a robot to dial multiple numbers at a time. Send a blast of 1000 emails, texts, voicemails at one time. Etc.

Generally speaking, you sacrifice personalization for scale. You get a higher response rate with personalized messages. The fewer leads you have, the less automation you should use.
- Hedge Fund VS Weight Loss

##### Pro Tip: Personalization Tech
The perfect combination for maximum leads is max personalization with max volume. And with tech, you don't always sacrifice personalization for scale. Everyday, data becomes more accessible to find personal data. If you can set up the tech to accomplish both - personalization and volume - you create a deadly effective lead-getting combo.


##### c) Follow up. More times. More ways. 
There are two more ways you can get more from your list of names.
##### More Ways
- The more ways you try to contact someone, the more likely you are to contact them 
	- For example, I never respond to phone calls. But, I reply to direct messages far more.
###### More Times
- ﻿﻿Contacting someone multiple times multiple ways shows them you are serious
	- ﻿﻿Doing so quickly communicates you have something important to discuss.  
	- Curiosity increases because they fear they're missing out.

##### Bottom line: Act like you're actually trying to get ahold of these people, rather than going through the motions, and you probably will.

##### Pro Tip: Don't be an nincompoop
If someone asks you not to contact them, don't contact them again. Not because there isn't a chance it could work. But because for the same effort, you could reach out to someone who isn't already negatively inclined. It's just more efficient to turn neutrals to YES than NO to YES. On top of that, you don't want a bad reputation. That kind of stuff follows you. Try hard because you have a genuine desire to solve their problems, but be respectful.

##### When you finish contacting your list, start back at the top again. This actually works for three reasons.
1. ﻿﻿﻿They do not see it the first time
2. ﻿﻿﻿They did not have time to respond
3. ﻿﻿﻿Their Circumstances have changed

##### Action Step. After you've attempted to contact them multiple times, multiple ways, wait three to six months. Then, do it again.

##### Pro Tip: If You Are New To An Outreach Team, Shadow The Best Guy On The Team.
Then, double their inputs. If they make 200 calls, make 400. If that means you work more - duh. You will suck before you are good. You can make up for your lack of skill with volume. Volume negates luck. And when you do twice as many, you'll get good in half the time. Once you beat their numbers, then you can get cute and try new things. Replicate before you iterate.

##### BONUS: Voicemail Script
"Hi (FIRSTNAME), it's (YOUR NAME). I'm calling in reference to (CURRENT CUSTOMERS NAME Please give me a call back at (NUMBER)"

Heres how it'd look like in reoi life. let's say you're targeting Adidas and Nike is one of your customers.

"Hi John, it's Alex. I'm calling in reference to Nike. Please give me a call back at + 1 (480) 522 7488

###### Why it Works
1. ﻿﻿﻿It's short. No need for your prospect to overthink it.
2. ﻿﻿it's relevant. I'm not mentioning just any company. I'm mentioning a competitor.
3. ﻿﻿﻿It opens a loop. Humans are curious by nature and hate open loops like I've just created here.
###### DO NOT DO
1. ﻿﻿﻿Say "This is (First name)"
2. ﻿﻿﻿Don't mention your company name
3. ﻿﻿﻿Fail to follow up
#### 5. ﻿﻿﻿Benchmarks
Three Problems Strangers Create-›Solved

Problem #1: "But how do I contact them?"
Problem #2: "I have my list, but what do I say to them?"
Problem #3: "I'm not getting enough chances to tell people about my amazing stuff, what do I do?"

##### Benchmarks-How well am I doing?
The two times I failed at cold outreach I hired people who never tracked metrics well. The third person did. And cold reach outs succeeded.

##### Phone Example:
- ﻿﻿100 cold calls per day
- ﻿﻿25% pick up rate (25 pickups)
- ﻿﻿25% want to take lead magnet (4 engaged leads)
- ﻿﻿4 hours to make calls = 1 engaged lead per hour

Email Example:
- ﻿﻿100 personalized emails per day
- ﻿﻿30% open (30 pickups)
- ﻿﻿10% of opens reply (3% of total are engaged leads)

##### Pro Tip: Give Each Rep An Explicit Number Of Leads To Work Every Week.
They should care for these leads like they are their children. If you give a rep too many, they will waste them. If someone can work one hundred leads at full capacity, I'll give them seventy-ish. That way, they have time and energy to squeeze everything they can out of the leads they've got. And since all reps get the same amount of leads every week, you can give them absolute quotas for deals. Ex: I give you seventy leads. You give me back seven appointments. I pay you. No leads left behind.

#### 6. ﻿﻿﻿This Sounds Hard, Why Bother?
1. ﻿﻿﻿You don't need to create lots of content or ads
2. ﻿﻿﻿Your competition won't know what you're doing.
3. ﻿﻿﻿It's incredibly reliable
4. ﻿﻿Fewer platform changes
5. ﻿﻿﻿Compliance is less painful
6. No spokesperson = Sellable business
7. Hard to copy

##### Author Note: Belief Breaking Volume - Scaling To 60,000 Emails Per Month
To break your beliefs around what is possible, here's an example. To break past $1,000,000 per month, we automated the entire process of scraping, crafting, and sending emails for one of our portfolio companies. One virtual assistant sends 2000 emails per day using multiple pieces of software. This generates the business 40 engaged leads per day. Note, the response rate dropped because we took out so much personalization. From there, they are able to get 10 percent of engaged leads sold. Meaning, they get four new customers per day. This got them past that 100 customers per month barrier. Fun Facts: They started with us at $250,000 per month (our minimum size requirement for investment at the time). The business makes $20,000 per customer. With four new customers per day, do the math at how big they are now. :)

## Make Ads
1. ﻿﻿﻿Quick Story
2. ﻿﻿﻿How paid ads work
3. ﻿﻿﻿Where to advertise
4. ﻿﻿﻿What should my ad say
5. ﻿﻿﻿How do I get their info
6. ﻿﻿﻿Conclusion

### 1. ﻿﻿﻿Quick Story
Alex became an apprentice for a gym owner

I'M LOOKING FOR 5 CHINO HILLS RESIDENTS TO TAKE PLACE IN A FREE 6 WEEK CHALLENGE. YOU MUST LET US USE YOUR BEFORE AND AFTER PICTURES IN OUR MARKETING IN EXCHANGE FOR THE PROGRAM. CLICK LINK TO SIGN UP: LINK

No images. No videos. No frills. -›Just words. ALL CAPS.

### 2. ﻿﻿﻿How paid ads work
Paid ads are a way to advertise one-to-many to cold audiences. People who don't know you. Paid ads work by paying another person or business to put your offer in front of their audience. Think of it like renting eyeballs or earballs.

"DO ADS WORK??" -> "How well you can make them work?"

#### Paid ads give us four new problems to solve. Let's break them down together:
1. ﻿﻿﻿Knowing where to advertise
2. ﻿﻿﻿Getting the right audience to see it
3. ﻿﻿﻿Making the best ad for them to see
4) Getting permission to contact them
### 3. ﻿﻿﻿Where to advertise
#### Step 1: "But where do I advertise?"  --> Find a platform where these four things are true
1. I've used it and gotten value from it as a consumer. So I have some idea how it works.
2. I can target people on the platform interested in my stuff.
3. I know how to format ads specific to the platform (which I'll dive into in step three).
4. I have the minimum amount of money to spend to place an ad.
##### Pro Tip: Place Ads Where Your Competitors Place Ads (To Start)
Platforms often have different ad types. For example, on Linkedin, you can send message ads or you can run newsfeed ads. On Instagram, you can run ads to the newsfeed or stories. On youtube, you can run ads on the side bar, mid stream, or as pre-roll. So how do you know where to start? Look at the ad placement of other people in your space, and start there. If they can make it work so can vou. Replicate before you iterate.
##### Action Steps: 
Start with one platform that meets the four requirements. And start watching, listening, or reading ads on the platform as a first step to learning how to make one.

### 4. ﻿﻿﻿What should my ad say
#### Step #2: "But how do I get the right people to see it?" --> Target them

So if we start with the entire world, which we kinda do, we need to be a bit more specific.

For example, if you choose a platform that has 100,000,000 users, you've already cut out 99% of the world
- Continue to cut down, specific is good.

First round = selecting our platform.
Second round is within the platform itself.

Modern advertising platforms have two ways to target. You can use them separately or combine them:

##### 1) Target a lookalike audience.  
Modern platforms can show your ad to an audience that is similar to, and much bigger than, a list you provide. Advertisers call this a lookalike audience.
- ﻿﻿upload their minimum list size to create lookalike audience
- ﻿﻿The bigger and better = better
- ﻿﻿Add warm reachout list, then cold reachout

##### 2) Target with factors of your choosing.  
Targeting options include: age, income, gender, interests, time, location, etc.

For example:
- ﻿﻿if you know no one over forty-five or below twenty-five has ever bought your thing, then exclude anyone outside that range.
- ﻿﻿If you sell car parts then show your ad during car shows and on car channels.
- ﻿﻿If only people with pets buy your thing, then include pets as an interest.
###### Pro Tip: Local Targeting
Since local markets are already tiny in comparison to national markets, you won't want to add many more filters. Be as specific as possible, but no further. 'The local market on its own is already.1% of a nation, so you're alteady pretty narrow.
###### Action Steps: Bring all your lead lists together into one place. Separate them by past and previous customers, warm outreach, and cold outreach.
1. ﻿﻿﻿Eventually you will have a list of people that engaged with your paid ads but did not buy. That will come in handy.
2. ﻿﻿﻿If the platform allows, use these lists in order of quality to create your lookalike audience
3. ﻿﻿﻿Then add filters on top to further optimize the list
*IF you are incapable of making a lookalike audience, then simply start by targeting interests. 

#### Step #3 "But what should my ad say?" --› Call Out + Value + Call to Action (CTA)
Note: Learn from other ads of competitors, so what you'll do is consume ads in your industry. Funnel HACKING
1. ﻿﻿﻿How they call out their ideal customers.
2. ﻿﻿﻿How they present the value elements.
3. ﻿﻿﻿How they give their audience a call to action.
##### Let's use the three chunks to make an ad.
1. ﻿﻿﻿Call Outs - I need to get them to notice my ad
2. ﻿﻿﻿Value - I need to get them interested in what I have to offer
3. ﻿﻿﻿Calls to Action - I need to tell them what to do next
##### 1. ﻿﻿﻿Call Outs 
1) Call Out: People noticing your ad is the most important part of the ad...by a lot.
- ﻿﻿The purpose of each second of the ad is to sell the next second of the ad. And the headline is the first sale.
	- ﻿﻿Focus your effort front to back.

This "first impression" is the part of the ad I test the most.

"After you've written your headline, you've spent eighty cents of your advertising dollar." - David Ogilvy

###### A callout is whatever you do to get the attention of your audience.
- ﻿﻿Labels
- ﻿﻿Yes-Questions
- ﻿﻿If-Then Statements
- ﻿﻿Ridiculous Results
###### ﻿﻿Labels
A word or set of words putting people into a group. These include features, traits, titles, places, and other descriptors.

Ex: *Clark County Moms* *Gym Owners* *Remote Workers* *I'm looking for XYZ* etc.

To be most effective, your ideal customers need to identify with the label.

(LOCAL AD HACK)
###### ﻿﻿Yes-Questions
Questions where if people answer "yes, that's me" they qualify themselves for the offer.

Ex: *Do you wake up to pee more than once a night?* *Do you have trouble tying your shoes?* *Do you have a home worth over $400,000?*
###### ﻿﻿If-Then Statements
If they meet your conditions then you help them make a decision.

*If you run over $10,000 per month in ads, we can save you 20% or more... *If you were born between 1978 and 1986 in Muskogee Oklahoma, you may qualify for a class action lawsuit...*If you want to XYZ, then pay attention...*
###### ﻿﻿Ridiculous Results
Bizarre, rare, or out of the ordinary stuff someone would want.

*Massage studio books out two years in advance. Clients furious.* *This woman lost 50 pounds eating pizza and fired her trainer* *The government is handing out thousand dollar checks to anyone who can answer three questions* Etc.



###### Callouts don't have to be just words. They can also be noises or visuals in the environment.
1. ﻿﻿﻿CONTRAST
2. ﻿﻿﻿LIKENESS
3. ﻿﻿﻿THE SCENE
###### ﻿﻿﻿CONTRAST
Any stuff that "sticks out" in the first few seconds. The colors. The sounds. The movements etc. Note what catches your attention. Ex:
1. ﻿﻿﻿A bright shirt almost always gets more attention than a black or dull shirt.
2. ﻿﻿﻿Attractive people almost always get more attention than plain looking people.
3. Moving stuff almost always gets more attention than still stuff.
###### LIKENESS
Think visually showing labels-features, traits, titles, places, and other descriptors that people identify with.

a) People want to work with people who look, talk, and act in ways familiar to them (and you may not look, talk, or act in ways familiar to them). So if you serve a broad customer base use more ethnicities, ages, genders, personalities etc. in your ads. If you serve a narrow customer base (ex: medical devices for seniors), then use people who look like them.
###### ﻿﻿﻿THE SCENE
Think showing the Yes-Questions and If-Then statements.
Ex: An ad with...
i) A person tossing and turning in bed calls out people with sleep troubles. 
ii) A pear next to an hourglass can call out people with a pear shaped body.
ii) A room full of stuff stacked to the ceiling calls out people with too much junk.
iv) A rock hitting a window calls out people with broken windows. 
v) A local landmark. Locals think - "Hey, I know that place!" and pay attention.


###### Action Step: 
I'm always impressed with the clever and innovative ways advertisers call out their prospects. So instead of muting or hitting "skip ad" look for the call outs. Become a student of the game. My goal is that for the rest of your life when you see an ad you turn up the volume.

##### 2. ﻿﻿﻿Value 
2) Get Them Interested. If people think an offer or lead magnet has big benefits and tiny costs, they value it. 
- ﻿﻿if the cost outweighs the benefits, they don't value it
- ﻿﻿the best ads make the benefits look as big as possible and the costs look as small as possible.
###### WHAT- WHO-WHEN FRAMEWORK
![Screenshot 2025-11-13 at 9.40.55 PM.png](/img/user/Atlas/Utilities/Images/Screenshot%202025-11-13%20at%209.40.55%20PM.png)
###### The What: Eight Key Elements
- ﻿﻿Dream Outcome
	- ﻿﻿Opposite - Nightmare
- ﻿﻿Perceived Likelihood of Achievement
	- ﻿﻿Opposite - Risk
- ﻿﻿Time Delay
	- ﻿﻿Opposite - Speed
- ﻿﻿Effort and Sacrifice
	- ﻿﻿Opposite - Ease
###### Dream Outcome:
A good ad will show and tell the maximum benefit the prospect can achieve using the thing you sell. It should align with the ideal prospect's dream outcome for that sort of product or service. These are the results they experience after buying the thing.
###### Opposite - Nightmare:
A good ad will also show them the worst possible hassles, pain, etc. of going without your solution. In short - the bad stuff they'll experience if they don't buy.
###### Perceived Likelihood of Achievement:
Because of past failures, we assume that even when we buy, there's a risk we don't get what we want.
- Lower perceived risk by minimizing or explaining away past failures, emphasizing the success of people like them, giving assurances by authority, guarantees, and how what you have to offer will at least give them a better chance of success than what they currently do, etc.
###### Opposite - Risk:
A good ad will also show them how risky it is to not act. What will their life be like if they carried on as they always have? Show how they will repeat their past failures and how their problems will get bigger and worse...
###### Time Delay:
A good ad will also show them how slow their current trajectory is or that they'll never get what they want at their current rate...
###### Opposite - Speed
To get things we want - we know we have to spend time getting them. A good ad will show and tell how much faster they will get the thing they want.
###### Effort and Sacrifice: 
A good ad will also show them the amount of work and skill they'll need to get the result without your solution.
- ﻿﻿How they'll be forced to keep giving up the things they love and continue suffering from the things they hate.
- ﻿﻿Or worse, that they work hard and sacrifice a ton right now... and have gotten..nowhere.
###### Opposite - Ease:
To get things we want - we know we have to change something. But we then assume we have to do stuff we hate and give up stuff we love. And ease comes from a lack of needed work or skill.
-  A good ad disproves the assumption. It tells and shows how you can avoid the stuff you hate doing, do more of the stuff you love doing, without working hard, or having a lot of skill and still get the dream outcome.










###### The Who
Humans are primarily status driven. And the status of one human comes from how the other humans treat them.
- ﻿﻿People gaining status, your customers.
- ﻿﻿People giving it to them: Spouse, Kids, Parents, Extended Family, Colleagues, Bosses, Friends, Rivals, Competitors, THEMSELVES etc.
Example:
-  Risk Free (WHO)

PERSONAL NOTE: Remember Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs - at the top is self-actualization which is the higher identity that they are striving towards, the WHO here is themselves, their higher identity, while the rest is below that part of the pyramid.
![Screenshot 2025-11-13 at 10.06.18 PM.png](/img/user/Atlas/Utilities/Images/Screenshot%202025-11-13%20at%2010.06.18%20PM.png)

###### The When
People often only think of how their decisions affect the here and now. But if we want to be extra compelling (and we do), we should also explain what their decisions led to in the past and what their decisions could lead to in the future. We do this by getting them to visualize through their own timeline (past-present-future).
Example:
-  Weight Loss

Note: This would give you and endless amount of ways to attack the prospect's belief system, so that you can persuade them to do the thing to help themselves.


###### Putting the What, the Who, and the When together, we answer WHY they should be interested.
Their spouse (WHO) will perceive how fast (WHAT) they fit into 'that suit your wife loves that didn't fit but does now' in the future (WHEN). Or, how their kids (WHO) month after month (WHEN) got more interested in eating healthy and tagging along during workouts (WHAT). Or, how they (WHO) catch a look at themselves in a reflection in the mall in a few months (WHEN) and realize 'stuff actually fits me in this store' (WHAT).
###### Pro Tip: Make Your Ads As Specific As You Can But No Specific-er
The more specific your copy the more efficient it can get, but also the longer it tends to get. And if it gets too long for the platform it lowers efficiency. So make the ad in its entirety as specific as you can in the most efficient space you've got. If you've got audio and visuals at your disposal then use contrast, likeness, and the scene itself to match your copy - It becomes more specific without getting any longer. And this makes your ad even more efficient and profitable.
###### When we combine:
- ﻿﻿everything we can to get the prospect going toward the four value drivers, while also getting them away from their opposites
- ﻿﻿the many perspectives we can show them gaining status, and
- ﻿﻿different timelines for each...
###### Pro Tip: Get Unlimited Inspiration.
Many platforms have a database of ads past and present. As of this moment, if you search "PLATFORM] ad library" in a search engine, in a few clicks you will find them. If you see an ad that runs for a long time (a month or more), assume it's profitable. Then, take notes on the callouts they use, how they illustrate the value elements, and their CAs. Look for the words they use and how they demonstrate them. Break down fifty or so ads and you will have a massive head start to creating winners of your own.
###### Action Steps: Get as many advertising angles with your offer as you can with the What-Who-When framework.

What: know the eight key things about your own product or service. How it fulfills each element of value, and how it helps avoid their opposites.

Who: Show how the eight key things about your product or service can change your prospect's status. Then, show how the people they know give status to the prospect when they buy your thing or take status away if they don't.

When: Get the prospect to see the consequences of buying and not buying through their past, present, and future. Especially through their change in status with people they know. This way, we help them to see the value of their decision (or indecision) at this very moment.
##### 3. ﻿﻿﻿Calls to Action 
If your ad got them interested, then your audience will have huge motivation... for a tiny time. Take advantage. Ill them exactly what to do next. S-P-E-L-L it out: Click this button. Call this number. Reply with "YES." Go to this website.

Make CTAs quick and easy. Easy phone numbers, obvious buttons, simple websites. For example, a common CTA is to direct the audience to a website. So make your web address short and memorable:
Instead of.. alexsprivateequityfirm.com/free-book-and-course2782
Use.. acquisition.com/training

Assume the audience has no idea who you are, what you do, how it works, they're in a rush, and they have a 3rd grade education.

### 5. ﻿﻿﻿How do I get their info
#### Step #4 "How do I get their info?" --› Get Permission To Contact Them
After they take the action-Get. Their. Contact. Information. My favorite way to get contact information is a simple landing page. Don't overthink it.
##### LANDING PAGES
![Screenshot 2025-11-13 at 10.12.10 PM.png](/img/user/Atlas/Utilities/Images/Screenshot%202025-11-13%20at%2010.12.10%20PM.png)
*The simpler your landing page, the easier it is to test. Focus on the words and the image. Here are my three favorite templates. Pick one and start testing.
- ﻿﻿Make your landing pages match your ads.
- ﻿﻿Get more people through more steps
Note: Friction reduces throughput but increases quality
###### Action Step: Build your first landing page.
I wasted four years feeling too scared to make a landing page. When I finally tried, I finished before lunch.
--›Now, you have engaged leads from paid ads! Hooray! We did it!
### 6. ﻿﻿﻿Conclusion
#### Run Paid Ads Part I Conclusion
1. ﻿﻿﻿Callouts (for them to notice it
2. ﻿﻿﻿Value Elements (to give them reason to do something)
3. ﻿﻿﻿Calls to action (to give them a way to do it)
Now... only one question remains... how efficient are we? Let's talk about money stuff.

## Monetize Ads
1. ﻿﻿﻿What matters most
2. ﻿﻿﻿How much to spend
3. ﻿﻿﻿How well you are doing
4. ﻿﻿﻿How to fix ads
5. ﻿﻿﻿What I wish I knew

### 1. ﻿﻿﻿What matters most
Efficiency matters more than creativity. All advertising works. The only thing that differs between advertisements is how well they work.

It's not about whether it works or not which is a BINARY QUESTION, but HOW WELL does it work. It's a spectrum

Paid ads it gets clear as day because you put X dollars in for people to see the ad and get Y dollars out if they buy your stuff. So if you want a $100M leads machine, you just need to get it "good enough" to scale.
![Screenshot 2025-11-13 at 10.18.49 PM.png](/img/user/Atlas/Utilities/Images/Screenshot%202025-11-13%20at%2010.18.49%20PM.png)

### 2. ﻿﻿﻿How much to spend
 There are three stages to spending money on ads as I see it.
 
Phase One: Track Money
Phase Two: Lose Money
Phase Three: Print Money
#### Phase One: Track Money
Track metrics to know what works and what doesn't
#### Phase Two: Lose Money
Imagine I spend $100 on ten ads - $1,000 in total. Nine of them lose all $100. Then, one of them makes $500 back for the $100 I spent.

I'm still down $500. Many people stop here because they see a $500 dollar loss. But not us. We see a winner.

So now we buckle up and 100x down

#### Phase Three: Print Money
If you're making back more money than you spend - the answer is simple - spend as much as you can. After all, if you had a magic machine that gave you $10 for every $1 you put into it, what would your budget be?
#### Note: If someone say they have a specific marketing budget, you already know that they don't understand how paid ads work because they don't know how to print

### 3. ﻿﻿﻿How well you are doing
#### "How well am I doing?" - Cost & Returns - Efficiency Benchmarks

![Screenshot 2025-11-13 at 10.32.01 PM.png](/img/user/Atlas/Utilities/Images/Screenshot%202025-11-13%20at%2010.32.01%20PM.png)
##### You have two big levers to improving
LTGP:CAC:
- ﻿﻿Make CAC lower - Get cheaper customers. We do this with more efficient ads following the steps we just outlined.
- ﻿﻿Make LTGP higher - Increase how much you make per customer. We do this with a better business model.
For maximum money... I prefer to do both.
![Screenshot 2025-11-13 at 10.35.38 PM.png](/img/user/Atlas/Utilities/Images/Screenshot%202025-11-13%20at%2010.35.38%20PM.png)
ALEX TARGET MINIMUM OF 10:1 on his portfolio companies, while some are 20 or 20+ to 1

###### IMPORTANT NOTE: BECOME A MONOPOLY
You can create a monopoly in your market by outbidding everyone.

Paid ads work on a auction system where the eyeballs will go to the highest bidder.

So if you can spend more than your competition and become more profitable than them, then you can set your bids higher than anyone can in your space, then you can drive up the CPM, which means you purposefully increase your CAC, so that nobody else, can and then they loss out because they can't spend more than you do. And that is how you can take over an entire market.

And it's better to increase LTGP because you can increase this to infinity, while you can only lower CAC so much. 



### 4. ﻿﻿﻿How to fix ads
#### "My ads aren't profitable, how do I fix it?" --> Client Financed Acquisition

For many businesses, LTGP is bigger than CAC. Yay. But not after the first purchase. Boo.

The profit from the customer's first purchase is often less than the cost to get them. It can take many months to collect the full LTGP.

So you get your money later instead of now. This cash flow problem cripples your ability to scale ads and get more customers..

But... if your customer spends more than it costs you to get and fulfill them-in the first 30 days-then you have the funds to scale now and forever. I call this client financed acquisition.

##### Let's see client financed acquisition in action:
- ﻿﻿Say we have a $15 per month membership that costs us $5 to deliver. That  
    leaves us $10 gross profit left over.  
    ($15 membership) - ($5 cost) = $10 gross profit per month
- ﻿﻿And let's say our average member stays for ten months. That makes our lifetime gross profit $100.  
    ($10 gross profit per month) × (10 months) = $100 LTGP.﻿﻿ 
- If the cost to get a customer is $30 (CAC = $30), we have a 3.3:1 LTGP CAC ratio.  
    ($100 LTGP) / ($30 CAC) = 3.3 LTGP / 1 CAC -› 3.3:1 Our ads make money.  
    Hoory.
![Screenshot 2025-11-13 at 10.54.05 PM.png](/img/user/Atlas/Utilities/Images/Screenshot%202025-11-13%20at%2010.54.05%20PM.png)
![Screenshot 2025-11-13 at 10.55.50 PM.png](/img/user/Atlas/Utilities/Images/Screenshot%202025-11-13%20at%2010.55.50%20PM.png)
##### Here's the way I fix it- I immediately sell them more stuff
- ﻿﻿If I offer a $100 upsell (with 100% margins) that one in five new customers take. That adds $20 of gross profit per customer.  
    ($100 upsell) / (5 customers) = $20 average upsell dollars per  
    customer.
- ﻿﻿This takes us from $10 to $30 in the first thirty days (our break-even window). The first purchase is $10. But now the average upsell adds $20.  
    $10 + $20 = $30 gross profit per customer in less than 30 days.
- ﻿﻿And since it costs $30 to acquire them, we break even. Great!  
    $30 CAC - $30 cash collected within thirty days = free customers!
### 5. ﻿﻿﻿What I wish I knew
#### 1. Don't Confuse Sales Problems With Advertising Problems.
The cost to get customers doesn't only come from advertising (it just mostly does)...

For example, a company I invested in spent twelve weeks and $150,000 to run paid ads. They were getting the right leads on the phone, but they weren't buying. The owner said advertising didn't work. But the ads worked fine, great even, their sales sucked. The owner threw up his hands and gave up..six inches from gold. Frustrating.

Confusing an advertising problem with a sales problem cost them an estimated ~$30M in enterprise value. If your engaged leads have the problem you solve and the money to spend, and they're not buying, then your ads work fine-you have a sales problem.

#### 2. Your Best Free Content Can Make The Best Paid Ads.
Some of the best paid ads I've ever run came from free content. If you make a free content piece that generates sales, or performs very well, nine times out of ten it'll make a great paid ad.

User Generated Content (UGC). If you can get your customers to create testimonials or reviews using your product, post them. If they perform well as free content, they often make killer ads too.
#### 3. If You Say You Suck At Something, You Will Probably Suck At It.
Never say "I'm not techy" or "I hate tech stuff." It just keeps you poorer than you should be. I said it for...wait for it...FOUR YEARS. Then one day, I snapped because I hated my website designer more than I hated tech itself. "If this idiot can do it, so can I." Four years of wasting time and lost money reversed with four hours of concentrated effort.
#### Checklist
![Screenshot 2025-11-13 at 11.14.45 PM.png](/img/user/Atlas/Utilities/Images/Screenshot%202025-11-13%20at%2011.14.45%20PM.png)

#### Personal Note on Identifying AD Budget
- Identify how many clients you can take on
	- ie. If you can only take on 20 clients per month, then you can reverse engineer it. Your CAC (without commissions purely ads) is $100, then your budget would be $2000, then divide that up per day, so if you run it for 20 days, then it would be $100 per day on ads
	- Your constraint is not on advertising but on your delivery, so after you fix your delivery, you can then go back and scale your ads
	- You can reverse it until you fix your constraint

## More, Better, New
### More Better New
1. ﻿﻿﻿More
2. ﻿﻿﻿Better
3. ﻿﻿﻿New

#### 1. ﻿﻿﻿More
You've done some advertising by now. And you know the advertising that you do works to some degree. So the next obvious thing you can do to get more engaged leads is - more. A lot more. Crank up the volume to your max capacity.
##### Here's how I do more: The Rule of 100
The rule of 100 is simple. You advertise your stuff by doing 100 primary actions every day, for one hundred days in a row. That's it.
##### Here's what it looks like applied to each of the core four:
Warm Reach Outs:
100 reach outs per day
Example primary actions: email, text, direct message, calls, etc.

Post Content:
100 minutes per day making content.
Release at least one per day on a platform. As you get better, post even more.
Example primary actions: short and long videos or articles, podcasts, infographics, etc
##### Here's what it looks like applied to each of the core four:
###### Cold Reach Outs:
100 reach outs per day
Example primary actions: email, text, direct message, cold call, flyers, etc. As with all cold advertising, expect lower response rates, so use automation.
###### Paid Ads:
100 minutes per day making paid ads.
Example primary actions: direct response media ads, direct mail, seminar, podcast spots, etc.
###### Pro Tip: More Ads Means Better Ads Means More Leads.
Facebook reviewed the accounts of all advertisers on their platform. They found something curious. The top .1% of advertisers test eleven times more creative than everyone else. Oftentimes, it's not that you can't scale an ad profitably. You just can't scale a mediocre ad profitably. And the only way to find the exceptional ads is to make eleven times more of them. Success leaves clues. Do what the .1% do to get what the .1% get.
#### 2. ﻿﻿﻿Better
Getting better gets you more leads for the same effort. We want that. And you can only get better by doing one thing-testing. So you do more and more…. until it breaks. Then, you make it better.

30% Optin (give you their contact information)
5% Apply < This is the constraint because it has the biggest drop-off
50% Schedule
But let's ignore the constraint for a moment. Imagine we improve each step by 5% by itself.
30 + 5%-›35% Optin = 16% Increase in leads (1.16x)
5 + 5% -›10% Apply = 100% Increase in leads (2x)
50 + 5%-×55% Schedule = 10% Increase in leads (1.1x)

##### Here's how I get better: I test one thing per week per platform. And I do it for four big reasons.
1. ﻿﻿﻿If you test multiple things at a time on one platform you never really learn what worked.
2. ﻿﻿﻿Steps affect each other. A single change can affect results at other steps.
3. ﻿﻿﻿It forces you to prioritize what will get you the most engaged leads. You can do an infinite amount of tests. But, time is limited. So you must choose your tests wisely.
4. ﻿﻿﻿Maybe the most important, you run the test for long enough to see if you actually get an  
    improvement. Too short and you won't get enough data. Too long and you waste time you could've spent improving the next constraint
Personal note:  SCIENIFIC METHOD

##### Pro Tip: Front > Back (most times)
In general, the lowest percentage steps usually happen at the front. And, the higher percentage steps happen at the back. As in 1% of people may click an ad then 30% will give you their contact information. This is why (most times) you'll end up focusing on the front more than the back. And that's fine. Those steps are usually the constraint. They have largest returns for the smallest improvements. The call out. The value elements. The offer. The CTA. The landing page headline. Sub headline. Image, etc. Down the pathway you go in order of what the lead will see and then do.
##### Pro Tip: Better, More, New
When talking to businesses less than $1,000,000 per year in profit, I usually advise them to do more first. They haven't done enough volume for percentage changes to make a big difference. But once you cross, $1,000,000 in annual profit, making things better can be the lowest cost, highest return thing you do. So once a business is big enough, I flip the order from "more, better, new" to "better, more, new."
#### 3. ﻿﻿﻿New
So after you've improved your marketing efforts through 'more' and 'better' the only thing you have left is - 'new places in new ways.' In simple terms-new.

Size of Pie FALLACY -> UNDERSTANDING MARKET SIZE
The most see their market
ONE METHOD
ONE PLATFORM
ONE MEDIuM

When to do new: When the returns you get from doing more < better are lower than what you could get from a new placement or new way of advertising.
EASY
NEW PLACEMENTS
NEW PLATFORMS
NEW CORE FOUR
HARD

##### Action Step: Exhaust more better first. 
Once you can't do anymore, any better (meaning the returns are lower than putting that same effort into a new platform) try new. Use this rough order: new placement, new platform, new core four activity. Get it going. Measure how you do. And scale up from there using more-better. Then, rinse and repeat.

### Section Ill: Get Leads Summary
Advertising is the process of making known. It's what we do to let strangers know about the stuff we sell. Now, we solved 'the stuff' with your lead magnet or offer. But to get them to turn into engaged leads, you have to tell them about it. So we spent this section going over the only four ways a single person can advertise-let other people know about their stuff.




# LEAD GETTERS:
### Building A $100M Lead Machine Is All About Leverage

LEVERAGE - THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN WHAT YOU PUT IN AND WHAT YOU GET OUT

Pro Tip: Don't Mistake Leverage for Speed
One person can only move so fast. A person 1000x ahead of you isn't moving 1000x faster. They can't. They're doing different stuff. So the future that feels so far away, with leverage, is closer than you think.

### 4 Scenarios:
Scenario #1: You are the lead getter. You do the core four all day everyday by yourself. You get enough leads to pay the bills
Scenario #2: You get a lead getter.
Scenario #3: You get lots of lead getters.
Scenario #4: You get a lead getter who gets lead getters.

## Referrals
Word of Mouth
1. ﻿﻿﻿Quick Story
2. ﻿﻿﻿How referrals work
3. ﻿﻿﻿Why most Businesses fail
4. ﻿﻿﻿Conclusion

### 1. ﻿﻿﻿Quick Story
Broke -> Ads Shut off -> $500k/week -> GymLords
### 2. ﻿﻿﻿How referrals work
A referral happens when somebody, a referrer, sends an engaged lead to your business. Anyone can refer, but the best referrals come from your customers.

#### How Referrals Grow Your Business
1. ﻿﻿﻿They're worth more (higher LTGP)
2. ﻿﻿﻿They costless (lower CAC)

REFERRALS = EXPONENTIAL GROWTH

#### REFERRAL GROWTH EQUATION
% CLIENTS REFERRED MONTHLY - % CLIENTS CHURNED MONTHLY = % MONTHLY COMPOUNDING GROWTH
1. Referrals are greater than churn: you grow without any other advertising (yay!)
2. ﻿﻿﻿Referrals are equal to churn: you need other advertising to grow your business (meh)
3. ﻿﻿﻿Referrals are less than churn: you've got to advertise to break even (boo - most folks)

### 3. ﻿﻿﻿Why most Businesses fail
#### Problem #1: The Product Isn't Good Enough
PRICE -PROFIT - VALUE RELATIONSHIP
![Screenshot 2025-11-13 at 6.37.53 AM 1.png](/img/user/Atlas/Utilities/Images/Screenshot%202025-11-13%20at%206.37.53%20AM%201.png)
##### Six Ways To Get More Referrals By Giving More Value
1. ﻿﻿﻿Call Outs -> Sell Better Customers
	- Look at who are the best clients and only sell to them because they are more qualified
2. ﻿﻿﻿Dream Outcome -> Set Better Expectations 
	- UNDERPROMISE OVERDELIVER > OVER PROMISE UNDER DELIVER
	- Data is important
3. ﻿﻿﻿Increase Perceived Likelihood of Achievement -> Get More People Better Results
	- Step #1: Survey customers to find the ones who got the best results.
	- Step #2: Interview them to find out what they did differently.
	- Step #3: Look at the actions they had in common.
	- Step #4: Force new customers to repeat the actions that got the best results.
	- Step #5: Measure the improvement in average customer results (speed and outcome)
	- Step #6: Match the conditions of your guarantee to the actions that get the best results to get more people to do them.
		- Pro Tip: Make The Success Activities The Conditions of Your Guarantee
			- DO NOT DO THIS IF YOU HATE MONEY AND HELPING PEOPLE: As soon as you start getting customers results, note what they did. Then, start guaranteeing new customers those results. But do it on the condition they do what the best customers did. 'The guarantee sells more people. The conditions get them better results. You win. They win.
4. ﻿﻿﻿Decrease Time Delay - Get Faster Results
	- MAKE FASTER WINS. FIGURE OUT HOW TO GET RESULTS FASTER THAN OTHERS.
	- Delivery
	- ﻿﻿Updates are wins.
		- Communicate milestones. Reward them each step and each milestones
	- ﻿﻿First 48 Hours
		- Make micro promise and commit to those promises so that they'll then trust your word 
	- ﻿Never leave them in "No Man's Land"
		- BAMFAM - Book a meeting from a meeting
	- ﻿﻿Never expect customers to forgive you.
5. ﻿﻿﻿Decrease Effort and Sacrifice -> Keep Making Your Stuff Better
	- Step #1: Use customer service data, surveys, and reviews to find the most common problem with your product.
	- Step #2: Figure out your fix.
	- Step #3: Use that feedback to improve your product.
	- Step #4: Give the new version to a small group of your (struggling) customers.
	- Step # 5: Get your next round of feedback. If you solved the original problem, then roll it out to all customers. If it didn't, go back to step #2.
	- Step #6: Move to the next most common problem and repeat the process. Do this until the end of time.
	- NOTE: This is the LTGP split test as opposed to CAC split test with ads
6. ﻿﻿﻿Call to Action -> Tell Them What To Buy Next
	- Tell them beforehand that you have other things that they would qualify in the future after they get results, then ask them if they want to be informed 


###### -> One Question to Rule Them All
Let's consolidate these six steps into one thought experiment. I encourage you to try it out with your team.

Here it is:
You've lost all your customers but one. The gods of advertising ban you from doing the core four and decree:
- ﻿All customers must come from this one customer.
- ﻿Violate our terms and we will destroy your business, and every other business you start, for eternity.
Tough break. But, the question remains....

- ﻿﻿How would you treat this customer?
- ﻿﻿What would you do to make their experience so valuable they would send all their friends?  
- What kind of results would they need to get? What would their onboarding be?
- ﻿﻿What type of customer would you pick?
#### Problem #2: You don't Ask for Them

Case Study #1: Dropbox gave free storage to customers and free storage to the friends they referred. The referral program went viral and they 39 x'd their business in fifteen months.

Case Study #2: Paypal gave $10 in credit to customers and $10 to the friends they referred. Within two years, the program helped them reach a million users, and six years later, they hit 100 million users. They still use it today.

##### Seven Ways To Ask For Referrals
1) One-Sided Referral Benefit: I'd rather pay customers than a platform any day of the week. Pay your average cost to acquire a customer (CAC) to the referrer or the friend. Make them aware of the incentive.
2) Two-Sided Referral Benefits: This is what Dropbox and Paypal used. We pay our CAC to both parties. Half goes to the referrer (in credit or cash) and half goes to the friend (in credit). This way, they both benefit.
	- ProTip: Run Your Paid Ads For Free
		- In our service businesses we routinely get an additional 25-30% of sign ups as referrals. If we asked for a referral right when they signed up. So if we signed up 100 clients for a promotion, we would usually get another 25-30 clients from referrals. And since we always operate above 3:1 LTGP:CAC, the cash from referrals often covered the cost of the ads (and some). Bingo bango.
3) Ask For A Referral Right When They Buy: On the sales contract or checkout page, ask for some names and phone numbers of people they'd like to do this with. Show them how they will get better results when they do it with a friend.
	- Position it to where they'll get better result if they go together with a friend
	- Pro Tip: Not "If" But "Who"
		- Once someone is a customer, be more direct with your ask. Don't ask IF they know someone, ask WHO they know.
4) Add Referrals As A Negotiation Chip: On top of that, you can ask for referrals as a way to negotiate a lower price. In other words, if someone wants to pay $400 and your price is $500, you can give them the discount in exchange for an introduction to three friends. You can ethically charge a different price for the same thing because you changed the terms of the sale.
5) Referral Events: Where people get points, credits, dollars or even just bragging rights for bringing friends within an explicit time period. Referral events typically last from one to four weeks. Whenever you run one of these events, sell everyone on the benefits of working with others.
	- basically ask them "Hey wanna double triple results? Bring a friend"
6) Ongoing Referral Programs: Instead of running a limited duration referral promotion, you talk about the benefits of doing things with others all the time. Think: in your free content, outreach, paid ads, etc. After a buddy did this, he saw a 33% boost in total sign ups. For context. he had 1,000,000 customers buy tickets to his virtual event and 250,000 of them were referred this stuff works
7) Unlockable Referral Bonuses: Create bonuses for people who 1) refer and 2) leave a testimonial. A few examples: Unlock VIP bonuses, courses, tokens, status, training, merchandise, service levels, premium support, additional hours of service, etc.
	- They bring a friend to unlock bonuses
	- Pro Tip: Match The Thing You Give With The Thing You Sell.
		- If you don't want to give away money, try to match the referral incentive to the core product you sell. For example, if you have a t-shirt manufacturing company, giving away free t-shirts makes a lot of sense. Because your incentive will attract people who actually want t-shirts. And they're more likely to become paying customers. (Hint: that's why the gift card works so well). 
		- On the other hand, if you give away an amazing limited edition t-shirt for your IT services business, it may or may not attract people who want IT services. So, try to match the thing you give with the thing you sell.

###### "Gift Card Play"
- Give everyone a gift card for one-third the cost of your service/thing.
- ﻿﻿Tell them they can give it to a friend of theirs if they sign up with them.
- ﻿﻿Give the gift card an expiration date within seven to fourteen days from the date you give it to them-›it'll force them to use it.
- ﻿﻿This gives the referrer status when they give it to their friend. Rather than saying "hey join my program for $2000 off" they say, "I got this gift card for $2000. Do you want it? I don't want to waste it." It's seen as a much bigger deal for them and you.
- You can still use the three-way introduction with this tactic. Then text a picture of the gift card.
- ﻿﻿Bonus points: if you write the friend's name on it before texting the picture. It makes it feel personalized and gives you a legitimate reason for asking for their friends name (wink).
- ﻿﻿PS - You can also sell the gift cards at ninety percent off as purchasable gifts (only for friends of customers). The referrer looks like they spent a lot of money, and you get paid to get new customers. I can hardly think of a better way to make money.
- ﻿﻿This is just an example of using the 7 we just went over - the only limit is your creativity.

### 4. ﻿﻿﻿Conclusion
Referring is always a risk for the customer. They risk their goodwill with their friend in the hopes of getting more by showing them something cool (your stuff). so customers only refer when they think it's very likely their friend will have a good experience.

MAKE GOOD STUFF AND ASK FOR THEM

##### Action Items:
Figure out your referral percentages and churn percentages to set a baseline.

Implement the six "giving value" steps to build goodwill. Then capitalize on that goodwill, using one or more of the seven ways to ask for referrals.

### 2. ﻿﻿﻿How Employees work
Lead-getting employees are people working in your business that you train to get you leads.
- ﻿﻿They get you leads the exact same way you got your own leads in the beginning
- ﻿﻿They can run ads
- ﻿﻿They can make and post content
- ﻿﻿They can do outreach
They can do any advertising you train them to do. So more lead-getting employees means more engaged leads for your business. It also means less work you have to do to get the leads.

Bottom Line: Employees make a fully functioning enterprise that grows without you.

### 3. ﻿﻿﻿Why employees make you wealthy

"If you want it done right, you gotta do it yourself."
"No one can do it like I do it."
"Nobody can replace me."

"If you want it done right, get someone to spend all their time doing it."
"If I can do it, someone else can do it better "
"Everyone is replaceable, especially me"

- ﻿﻿Step One - Document. You make a checklist.
- ﻿﻿Step Two - Demonstrate: You do it in front of them.
- ﻿﻿Step Three - Duplicate: They do it in front of you.
	- you give them feedback
	- they give themselves feedback
#### Pro Tip: Give Short Windows For People To Prove Themselves.
Most entry level advertising jobs aren't complex. It takes grit more than skill. If you trained someone properly and they're still below expectations three weeks in, cut them.

### 7. ﻿﻿﻿How to Calculate Returns
- Total Payroll / Total Engaged Leads = Cost per engaged lead.
- ﻿﻿Ex: $100,000 / 1000 leads = $100 per engaged lead
- ﻿﻿If one out of ten of the engaged leads become customers then our CAC is $1000
- ﻿﻿($100 per engaged lead) × (10 engaged leads per  
    customer) = $1000 CAC
- ﻿﻿If each customer has an LTGP of $4000 then you have an LTGP:CAC of 4:1  
	- ($4000 LTGP) / ($1000 CAC) = 4:1

How To Know Which Employees to Focus On To Maximize Returns
If your CAC is more than 3x industry average then you have a sales problem or an advertising problem. We diagnose this with a single question:

Do my engaged leads have the problem I solve and the money to spend?

- ﻿﻿If no, then they're not qualified-that's an advertising problem.
- ﻿﻿If yes, then they're qualified and:  
    - They're buying but you don't have enough of them-advertising problem  
    - They're qualified but not buying-sales problem.

Author Note: A Word On Fancy Employees
I explicitly left out recruiting director level and up employees because you can easily qualify for Acquisition.com without them. And once you do become a portfolio company, we do it for you.

### 3. ﻿﻿﻿Hiring VS DIY
1. ﻿﻿﻿Learning new methods
2. ﻿﻿﻿Learning new platforms
Action Step: As soon as you have enough money for a good agency, start poking around. If you follow the rest of the steps in this chapter, you'll make it all back... and then some.
### 4. ﻿﻿﻿How I use agencies
"I want to do what you do in my business, but I don't know how. I'd like to work with you for 6 months so I can learn how you do it. Plus, I'll pay extra for you to break down why you make the decisions you do and the steps you take to make them. Then, after I get a good idea of how it all works, I'll start training my team on it. And once they can do it well enough, I'd like to change to a lower cost consulting arrangement. This way, you can still help us if we run into problems. Are you opposed to this?"

Action Step: When you find an agency to work with (next step) set terms with them and deadlines for yourself. Use the template above as your guide. And feel OK with negotiating a bit to make it work.

##### Author Note: Yes, There's a Place For Agencies
To be clear; I still own equity in an agency software, ALAN. So I'm not against agencies. I just share how I've had success with them. Are there massive companies that use huge ad agencies? Sure. But they're not who I'm writing for. For most people, spending $10,000, $50,000, or $100,000 on an agency is a significant cost. So, this is how I've gotten the best return from working with them. Also - some people never want to learn - and for those people - agencies are great. I personally always want to learn, which is why I use agencies this way.

### 5. ﻿﻿﻿How to pick the right agency
#### Alex's List
- ﻿﻿Somebody I know got good results working with them.
- ﻿﻿Prominent companies got good results working with them. I may not know the companies personally, but if I recognize them, it's a good sign.
- ﻿﻿A waiting list. When demand for a service exceeds the supply, they are probably pretty good.
- ﻿﻿A clear sales process that makes a point to set realistic expectations. No funny business.  
- No short term hacks. They keep the talk on long term strategy. They also give clear timelines for setup, scaling, and results.
- They tell me exactly what they need from me, when they need it, and how they use it.
- They suggest a regular schedule of meetings and offer several ways to update me on their progress.
- They give updates in simple terms and have clear ways to track so I know how costs compare with results.
- They make a good offer:
	- Dream outcome: is what they promise what I want?
	- Perceived likelihood of achievement: how many other people like me have they gotten there?
	- Time delay: how long will it take?
	- Effort and sacrifice: what do they require me to do when working with them? What will I have to give up? Can I stick with those for a long time?
- They are expensive. All good agencies are expensive... but not all expensive agencies are good. So talk with as many as it takes. And use this list to find the good ones.
	- ...if an agency checks those boxes, they're worth considering.

#### Pro Tip: Talk To More Agencies To Be A Better Customer
Being an informed customer helps everyone. So, before you buy, get informed. Talk to five or ten agencies to learn how they work. At first - you'll learn a bunch of new stuff. But over time, the difference between the better ones and the worse ones becomes obvious. Now, you can make an informed decision.

If the agency doesn't meet my needs, but I like the people, I'll ask them to refer me to another agency. A good agency offering a one specialty will send you to other good agencies who offer the one you want. Those are some of my favorite referrals.

Action step: Even if an agency agrees to your terms, talk with a few more before you make a decision. Compare them using the checklist above, and then pick the best one for you.
### 6. ﻿﻿﻿Next steps
Next Steps:
1. ﻿﻿﻿Decide if using an agency makes sense for you right now.
2. ﻿﻿﻿Talk to a lot of agencies to get a feel for the market. Don't be cheap.
3. Use the agreement framework I outlined.
4. ﻿﻿﻿Set a clear deadline to force you (and your team) to learn the skills.
5. ﻿﻿﻿Use both teams until yours beats theirs regularly.
6. ﻿﻿﻿Switch to discounted consulting until you feel like you're teaching them instead of them teaching you...then cut 'em loose.

### 2. ﻿﻿﻿How affiliates work
An affiliate is a lead-getter. They are an independent business that tells their audience to buy your stuff. Affiliates seem like referrals on the outside, but are much different under the hood.

### 3. ﻿﻿﻿How to build an army
#### How To Build An Affiliate Army in Six Steps

##### Step 1: Find Your Ideal Affiliate
The ideal affiliate has a business with a warm audience full of people like your customers. Start making a list of those businesses

If none come to mind, answer these questions about your best customers:

- What do they buy? - Who provides that stuff?
- Where do they go? - What businesses are in those surrounding areas?
- What do they like to do? - Who provides those services?
- If direct to consumer - the employers of your consumers could make great affiliates:
- What types of businesses do they work for? What kinds of jobs do they have?

##### Step 2: Make Them An Offer
We make the affiliate-offer and advertise it the same way we would any other offer. We call out our audience, show our value elements, and then call them to action.

Hint: A new way to make money

###### Call out:
Call outs for potential affiliates often include:
- ﻿﻿The affiliate business owners themselves - ATTENTION SPA OWNERS
- ﻿﻿The affiliate's customers - Do you work with busy professionals who spend all day in meetings?
- ﻿﻿Results the affiliate businesses promise - To the heroes who heal the stress of others...
- ﻿﻿Products and services the affiliates deliver - If you sell lotions or scented oils this is for you...  
- To our own customers - Do you know anyone who owns a spa?
Now that we can grab a potential affiliate's attention - let's make it worth their while...

###### Elements Of Value
There's an unlimited amount of ways to show value, but all money making offers follow a similar structure. That's good news, we don't need to reinvent the wheel. Most affiliate money making offers show value like this:

Make more money from your current customers and get more leads than your current offer (dream outcome).with a high chance of working since your customers already want the product (perceived likelihood of achievement)...without needing to build, deliver, or provide customer support for the product yourself (effort and sacrifice)..so you can start selling it tomorrow (time delay).


##### Step 3: Qualify Them
Potential affiliates become actual affiliates when they understand and agree to your terms. And - just like customers - we want to get them their first win as fast as possible. So we setup our terms to force them to win as fast as possible.
######  Way #1: Make Them A Customer:
- You GoTTA Buy IT To ETHICALLY Sell IT.
###### Way #2: Make Them An Expert:
- You GoTTA kNOw WHAT YOu'RE TALKING ABOUT
##### Step 4: Figure Out What To Pay Them
The first biggest problem to solve with affiliates is getting them bought in. But the second biggest problem is how to keep them bought in.
- Money + Free stuff

1. ﻿﻿﻿What They Get Paid For - What exactly do I want the affiliate to do? Once I figure that out, that is what I pay them for
2. ﻿﻿﻿How Much They Get Paid - Maximum allowable cost to acquire a customer (CAC).

Example: choosing your maximum allowable CAC. (FROM EXPERT CONSULTANT)
- ﻿﻿Tier 1: 25% CAC = $10 Payout - Anyone who agrees to my initial terms.
	- ﻿﻿Example: They sign up and buy products or a certification.
- ﻿﻿Tier 2: 50% CAC = $20 Payout - Once they activate.  
	- Example: actually finishing the certification they bought, doing a specific number of posts and outreach, doing a launch, etc.
	- This gives them a nice reward (twice the pay) for activating.
- Tier 3: 100% CAC = $40 Payout - Once they sustain a level of performance.

###### Pro Tip: Pay With Product If Possible "Sell 3 Get It Free"
Everyone likes free stuff. Often, more than what it would cost them to get it. Rewarding performance with product is a cheap and effective way to keep them winning. They value it at retail, but it only costs you - your cost. A nice arbitrage of value.

Set sales tiers and bonus your affiliates with product or credit toward the retail cost. At lower tiers, you can even compensate exclusively with free stuff. For example: If your affiliates send you tons of massage clients, it's totally acceptable to reward your affiliates with free massages. At low amounts, a massage is often worth more to them than sending them a check for $30 (your cost). But as affiliates send you more customers, they'll usually opt for more money. After all, cashing in 100 massages becomes unrealistic.

At Prestige Labs, I offered anyone who sold more than three packages per month a free $200 bundle of their choosing. 'This also made every affiliate a sponsored athlete. They got free products for life as long as they kept three clients per month buying. I called it "Sell three get it free"

##### Step 5: Get Them Advertising - Launch
WHISPER - > TEASE - > SHOUT

Whisper: Think "Callouts." Like an ad, the key to the whisper phase is curiosity. Keep the product itself mysterious and hint at how big of a deal it is. Keep whispers short.

Tease: Think "Elements Of Value." It's time to start satisfying all the curiosity you created during the whisper phase. Reveal your product, make the date of the launch public, and start showing the elements of value. Use the What-Who-When Framework from the paid ads chapter.

Shout: Think "Call to Action." Give specific actions for the audience to take when the product launches. Now you start pounding the audience with bonuses, scarcity, urgency, and guarantees around being "the first ones." You shout to get as many people exposed to your offer as you can.

##### Step 6: Keep Them Advertising
###### 1) Affiliates Give Your Lead Magnet Away When Somebody Buys Their Stuff.
![Screenshot 2025-11-13 at 9.41.20 AM.png](/img/user/Atlas/Utilities/Images/Screenshot%202025-11-13%20at%209.41.20%20AM.png)
The idea here is for your lead magnet to make the affiliate's offer more valuable. This allows them to charge more for it and get more leads than they could without it.
- ﻿﻿Samples And Trials
- ﻿﻿Reveal a Problem
- ﻿﻿One Step In A Multi-Step Process
###### Case Study: 
- Friend who sold LLC services and so he partnered with biz op coaches since new business owners needed LLC. He offered his LLC service for free as lead magnet for the coaches , then after they used LLC, he then upsold them on accounting, bookkeeping and tax services
- Oil Product seller doing a massage oil workshop and he basically used the workshop as a lead magnet an he partnered with a massage company so it makes it a lot more valuable

###### Pro Tip: White Label Lead Magnets
One of my favorite strategies is to let them use the lead magnets I've already made for my audience, for theirs. Just make sure your affiliates agree with how you give value and understand your call to action. At most, a few tweaks in the copy will make your lead magnet work for them. For example, for gyms, I made white-labeled (no logo) meal plans, grocery lists, and food prep instructions. I gave them to the gyms to use as lead magnets for their customers. All they had to do was slap their logo on it - and boom - their audience got to benefit from all my work instantly. And, we both got more leads.

###### 2) Affiliates Sell Your Lead Magnet (UPSELL LEAD MAGNET VS FREE)
![Screenshot 2025-11-13 at 6.52.21 PM.png](/img/user/Atlas/Utilities/Images/Screenshot%202025-11-13%20at%206.52.21%20PM.png)
Basically, the affiliate can sell anything of yours that turns their customers into your customers. It could be a book, an event, a service, software, a sample product, etc

Note: Give all the proceeds of the lead magnet to the partner. You want them maximally incentivized to bring people to your business

Case Study:
- Chiropractor partnered with a Gym owner or anybody who owned a community, and then they set up a $99 3-hour workshop for posture assessment to get the most out of their workout and the gym/community owner keeps 100% of the money. Then the chiropractor, after providing value to the customers, can now upsell other services.

###### 3) Affiliates Sell Your Core Offer.
![Screenshot 2025-11-13 at 6.52.06 PM 1.png](/img/user/Atlas/Utilities/Images/Screenshot%202025-11-13%20at%206.52.06%20PM%201.png)
An affiliate sells your core offer directly to their customers and adds another source of income without extra work. For some affiliates, this is their entire source of income!

Example: They sell your entire massage package. They sell your entire program or services. They bundle their services with your paid services and charge an even higher price.
###### Case Study: Prestige Labs
- Give free thing and then we upsell
- Twice a year running a transformation challenge which is a free webinar which is a kickoff for a massive national challenge with prizes for those who has the biggest transformation. To participate in the challenge, all they have to do is buy the product. 
- The affiliates just funnel their audience to the webinar and Prestige Labs will sell for them. 

###### Pro Tip: Employees Are Leads Too

Companies that hire a lot of people make great affiliates. This is HUGE for direct to consumer businesses and wildly underused.

Example: Every new hire at a company gets a free massage in their new employee packet. Or, you can give free massages to their employees at lunch. It's free. It's easy. And lots of companies want to provide more value to their teams. They get free value, you get free leads. And since they're probably not in the same business as you, there's no risk of you competing with theirs. So employers can be among the easiest affiliates to integrate with.

### 4. ﻿﻿﻿Cost and returns
"Affiliates can't work for my business" the loser said.
"I have to make affiliates work for my business" the winner said. Be a winner. 
#### Cost and Returns
To calculate returns, we compare how much it costs us to get an affiliate with the gross profit of all the customers they send to our business.

Example:
Let's say we own a widget company that grows with affiliates.
- ﻿﻿It costs us $4000 in advertising to get an affiliate. CAC = $4000
- ﻿﻿Our average affiliate sells $10,000 in widgets per month and stays for 12 months.  
	- ($10,000 per month ) × (12 months) = $120,000 total sales
- The widgets have 75% gross margins. In other words, they cost 25% of retail price to make.  
	- ($120,000 total sales) × (25% cost of goods) = $30,000 total cost of goods
	- ($120,000 total sales ) - ($30,000 total cost of goods) = $90,000 in gross profit from all the customers the affiliate brings
- ﻿﻿We pay affiliates 40% of the gross profit
	- ﻿﻿($90,000 gross profit) × (40% payout) = $36,000 to the affiliate as payment.
- ﻿﻿Here's the gross profit we have left after cost of goods and payouts:  
    - ($120,000 total) - ($30,000 costs) - ($36,000 payouts) = $54,000 leftover
- ﻿﻿Let's find our affiliate LTGP to CAC ratio:  
    - ($54,000 gross profit left / ($4000 to get an affiliate) = 12.5:1  
    …Not too shabby.

Note: Outreach works for Physical Products where instead of directly reaching out to customers, you reach out to people that can sell your products in bulk for you.

##### IF your actual LTGP: CAC is less than 3, here are the three ways to improve it:
1. ﻿﻿﻿Lower CAC: We get affiliates for less (by improving our ads, offer, and sales process).
2. ﻿﻿﻿Increase LTGP & Decrease CAC: Get more to activate (by creating a launch process).
	A. Adding a launch process or activation process of the affiliates, adding the affiliate tiers to incentivize them to become active
3.  ﻿﻿﻿Increase LTGP: We make them worth more (by improving our integration process).
	A. This is the KEEP THEM ADVERTISING 3 PART - Them giving something for free, them selling the lead magnet so it allows you to upsell your core offer, them selling your thing directly
### 5. ﻿﻿﻿Conclusion
Like referrals, affiliates aren't an advertising method you can 'do.'

They're people who advertise your stuff to benefit you both. You do the core four to get them, and if you want them to love you, then you treat them like customers.

There are two ways to create a compounding business. You can find more people that never stop buying your stuff or you can find more people who never stop selling it for you. Referrals are the former. Affiliates are the ladder.

Action Steps: Advertise your affiliate offer until you get ten to twenty affiliates. Get results with those affiliates and use their feedback to work the kinks out of your offer, terms, launches, and integration strategy. Then, scale like crazy by turning their results into your first batch of affiliate lead magnets.

## Roadmap
Level 1: Your friends know about the stuff you sell. To start getting engaged leads, you make one offer, to one avatar, on one platform. The moment you get engaged leads, is the moment you can start making money. For me, this started with reaching out to everyone I knew.
Primary Action: Warm outreach.


Level 2: You consistently let everyone you know about the stuff you sell. You know the exact inputs to get an engaged lead with your chosen advertising method. For me, on top of warm reach outs, I maximized my personal work capacity with paid aids, using a case study as my lead magnet. But looking back, I wish I would have started with posting free content. So I suggest that.
Primary Actions: Do as much warm outreach and post as much content as you can consistently.


Level 3: You get employees to help you do more advertising. You've maxed your personal advertising inputs, but not the platform. And if you want more engaged leads that can only mean one thing. Doing more. For me, I hired a videographer and a media buyer to take most of the paid ads work off my plate.
Primary Action: You hire people to advertise profitably on your behalf.


Level 4: Your product is good enough to get consistent referrals. You continue building goodwill and shoot for getting 25% or more of your customers from referrals. Now, you've set yourself up to ramp your advertising again. But to make that work, you have to get more serious about hiring a team to make it happen.
Primary Actions: Focus on your product until you get consistent referrals then go back to scaling your advertising with a bigger team. This is where most people mess up. They let their product slip and never recover.


Level 5: You advertise in more places in more ways with more people. First, you expand to new audiences on your best platform. Then, you make ads with all placements and media types the platform supports. And, after your team can get consistent results, you expand your team again to add: another platform, lead-getter, or core four activity.
Primary Action: Advertise profitably using at least two methods on multiple platforms.


Level 6: You hire killers. Your executives grow departments specific to an advertising method or platform without you. And you're not looking for potential. You're looking for experienced leaders specializing in exactly what you want.
- ﻿﻿Veteran Executives
- ﻿﻿Stronger Incentives
Primary Action: Get battle-hardened executives and department heads to take over new advertising activities and channels.
Pro Tip: Hire Experience, Not Potential. I tried cold reach outs twice before it worked the third time. 'The main difference: the person I hired to run it. First, I tried someone external with experience - that failed. 'Then I tried internally with no experience - that failed. Then finally, I hired internally with experience - that worked. Since it's a people heavy, operationally complex machine, the person you hire to manage the team matters a lot. Pick experience. They should know more than you do. If you're not learning from them in the interview, you've got the wrong person.


Level 7: I'll come back and edit this chapter once I cross a billion. I promise, I'll send the lessons as soon as I have them. You have my word.


Last Points: I know this looks clean. But it never is. Real business is messy. It takes a lot to find what audiences, lead magnets, methods, and platforms work best. And you can only find out what works if you try. So you have to try a lot of different things, a lot of different ways, for a long enough time to know for sure.

Nobody can ever know the absolute best thing to do. But I do know this: the more you advertise, the more people find out about the stuff you sell. The more people who know about the stuff you sell, the more people will buy it. This is the key to the $100M Leads Machine.


The $100M+ Lead Machine
- ﻿﻿Your media team scales tons of free content, in all media types, on many platforms.
- ﻿﻿You regularly make offers to your warm audience to get more customers or affiliates.
- ﻿﻿Your ravenous audience makes anything you launch immediately profitable.
- ﻿﻿You have teams running and scaling profitable paid ads across multiple platforms.
- ﻿﻿Your cold outreach team gets you more customers.
- ﻿﻿You have an affiliate manager launching and integrating all new affiliates.

- ﻿﻿Your product is so good that a third of your customers bring you more customers.
- ﻿﻿Your executive team drives all this growth without you.
- ﻿﻿And... you have more engaged leads than you can possibly handle.

Entrepreneurship isn't for the faint of heart.
The load is heavy and the road is long.

#### The point of the game is simple: Roll green as many times as you can.
The rules of the game are as follows:
- ﻿﻿You can't see how many sides you have. You can only see if you roll red or green.
- ﻿﻿If you roll green-One of your red sides turns green, and you get to roll again.
- ﻿﻿If you roll red-Nothing happens, and you get to roll again.  
- The game ends when you stop rolling. And if you stop rolling, you lose.

What do you do?
You roll. When you roll red, you pick up the die and roll again. When others roll green, you pick up your die and roll again. When you roll green, you pick up the die and roll again. You keep telling yourself one thing. "The more I roll, the more greens I get." At first, you roll green once in a while. But as more red sides turn green, the greens happen more. With enough rolls, hitting green becomes the rule rather than the exception.

What does your friend do?
He rolls a few times and hits red each time. He sees you roll a green and complains that you must have a die with fewer sides. He reasons, it's the only way you could have rolled green before him. And although you did, you also rolled many more times. So which is it?

 So who got the die with 20 sides? Who got the die with 200 sides? If you get the game then you see, once you roll enough times, the die you're given doesn't matter.
- ﻿﻿Die with fewer sides might roll green sooner.
- ﻿﻿Die with more sides might roll green later.
- ﻿﻿But, a die with a green side always has a chance of rolling green... if you roll it.  
- Every die hits its green streak when rolled enough times.

#### The only two guarantees:
- ﻿﻿1) The more times you roll, the better you get.
- ﻿﻿2) If you quit, you lose

During my hardest days, I repeated the same phrase to myself:
I cannot lose if I do not quit.
