# Writing

_You will be writing your draft in your favorite writing software (TweetHunter, Hemingway, Google Docs, etc)_
**Style of Post**
- [ ] Story (a full-blown story)
- [ ] List (step-by-step how-to or straight list)
- [ ] Advice (how-to)
- [ ] Concept (your own theory or concept)
- [ ] All Of The Above

**APAG Outline**
_Be sure to follow a general persuasive writing framework:_
- **Lead** — the big problem and agitating that problem.
- **Body** — The transformation and benefits associated with it.
- **Conclusion** — Wrap it up and leave with value.
- **CTA** — tell them what to do next.

_Keep that structure in mind when using the APAG framework._
- ## _**Attention**_ — use a personal story or start with a problem
    - 
- ## _**Perspective**_ — paint a picture of a common perspective with the problems associated with it.
    - 
- ## _**Advantage**_ — show them why your perspective is better and the benefits associated with it.
    - 
- ## _**Gamify**_ — bring clarity to how they can achieve it with steps, a challenge, and a timeframe.
    - 

_The style of post will have an impact on how long each of the APAG components are. None of this is set in stone._
